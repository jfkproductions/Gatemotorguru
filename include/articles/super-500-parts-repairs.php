<h1>Super 500 Gate Motor Parts and Repairs</h1>
<p>
    Everyone is struggling to find parts for their Super 500 Gate Motors in order to repair their Super 500's.
</p>

<h2>Whats a Super 500 Gate Motor</h2>
<p>
    Its a gate motor usually sold through retail chains, as a do-it-yourself gate motor, with little support.
</p>

<h2>Getting Parts and Support for your Super 500</h2>
<p>
    It is therefore little surprise that its virtually impossible to find spares for this motor.
    This means no-one can help, and none of the experts can repair it, or replace faulty components.
</p>

<h2>What to do if you are having trouble with your Super 500 Gate Motor</h2>
<p>
    The sad news is, that it cannot be economically repaired, and your best option is to replace it with one of
    the locally manufactured or otherwise well-supported major brands of gate motors such as the
    <a href="centurion-d5-gate-motor.php">Centurion D5 Gate Motor</a>.
</p>

<p>
    If its still under warranty, take it back to the place you've bought it from.
</p>

    Alternatively let us help you get a replacement motor installed.
