<h1>Gate Motor Strength and Reliability</h1>

<h2>How to decide how strong a gate motor you need?</h2>
<p>
The two main factors that influence the strength/size/capacity of gate motor required:
<ul>
    <li>The size and weight of the gate.</li>
    <li>How often the gate is opened and closed per day.(Normal Residence vs Complex vs Office entrance)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Using the right kind of gate motor for the expected load and strain is important for reliability and gate motor life span.
</p>

<p>
Another key factor, is correct installation. The gate must slide smoothly, with no friction. A bad installation severely shortens
the useful life of a gate motor and reduces its reliability, causing unnecessary wear and tear.
</p>

<h2>Typical Residential Applications</h2>
<p>
For a low traffic, light gate, and a price-sensitive shopper, we recommend the Centurion D3.
</p>
<p>
For nearly all other residential applications we recommend the Centurion D5. Its not much more expensive than the D3, but it is
definitely the tougher motor to go for - the one we recommend most often to our clients.
</p>

<h2>Heavy Duty Gates or High Traffic Areas</h2>
<p>
Here one needs to consider the heavier duty industrial grade gate operators such as the Centurion A10 Gate Motor.
